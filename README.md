Commerce-Labs-Evaluator
=======================

In an effort to improve service levels, Commerce Labs Evaluator is a logging utility that allows for the capturing of authenticated students' complaints over a period of time. Complaints are sorted into defined Types and Sub Types which are set up through the Management Module application. Commerce Labs Evaluator is a simple SQL Server driven application that interfaces with the local UCT LDAP server for student authentication.  Created by Craig Lotter, November 2005
